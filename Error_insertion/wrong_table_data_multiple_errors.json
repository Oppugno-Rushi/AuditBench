            "Error Resolution": "The 'Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents' was incorrectly stated as $2,015 instead of the correct $1,015. This error affects the visible consistency between the initially reported change in cash and the cash calculation (beginning balance + change should equal the ending balance). To resolve this, correct the amount back to $1,015 to align with the formula: Cash and cash equivalents at end of period ($3,845) should equal the beginning balance ($2,830) plus the actual increase of $1,015.",
            "Standards Citation": "According to FASB ASC 230-10-45-27, 'The statement of cash flows shall report cash flows during the period classified according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities.' Thus, accuracy in reporting is essential."

            "Error Resolution": "The 'Interest' expense, which is financial information, was erroneously listed under the row 'Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period'. It should be moved to its correct place under 'Supplemental disclosures to the consolidated cash flows'. The misclassification could confuse the interpretation of financing activities and cash flows. To correct this, move 'Interest' to a row under 'Net cash paid during the period for:' so it accurately reflects supplemental disclosures.",
            "Standards Citation": "FASB ASC 230-10-45-28 outlines the requirement for interest paid to be disclosed separately in the cash flow statement. This misclassification disregards proper financial statement presentation rules."
